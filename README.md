# Project's purpose

This project goal aims at delivering a working solution for a book reading session conclusion gathering system.
It is created with belief that writing down the conclusions of a book reading session is a good practice to help the reader to remember the key points of the book and to help the reader to understand the book better.

# Project's REAL purpose

Ok, there's no actual philosophy behind this project. I just want to learn how to use Vite, React, and TypeScript together.

# Technology stack

Frontend for now uses: React + TypeScript + Vite. 
Backend will be implemented with Ruby on Rails, as I am familiar with it.
Tests will be written with Jest and Cypress, unless I'll discover they are the same, or something.
Style of code shall we handled by prettier and eslint, but for now I'm the one in charge.

On addition this project will use Material UI for styling.

# How to run the project

After cloning the project, run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Project should be running on `localhost:5174`. If it does not start - sorry, I can't help you. I am still learning this stuff.
